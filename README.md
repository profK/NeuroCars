# NeuroCars
This is the codebase for the Neurocars experiment.  It is 100% C# written in the Unity3D environment
For more information see the project page at https://engineering.purdue.edu/evolvingactors/research/neurocars

Note that this code base is messy rght now and contaisn a lot of dinosaur cruft.  The original version was written some years ago to support both an ANN and a fuzzy and machine.  It was written using the Unity reacing car demo code which is now moribund.  I added the AnyCar car physics system and converted the ANN to use it, but I havent converted the fuzzy and machine or cleaned out the old code yet.
